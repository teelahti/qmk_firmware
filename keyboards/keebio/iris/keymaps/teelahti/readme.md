# Nordic layout with easy access to coding symbols

A layout that is a transition layout towards 40% split; all current functionality
like number row still works, but same functionality can also be found elsewhere.

When moving to 40% the most important change will be how layers are switched to.

Inspiration taken from [Miryoko](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/). One remaining
difference is the combined navigation + coding symbols layer I've gotten used to and
cannot change easily. Also, there are still separate buttons for GUI and SHIFT for easier
learning curve.
