# Finnish layout with easy access to coding symbols

A layout that is a transition layout towards 40% split; all current functionality
like number row still works, but same functionality can also be found elsewhere.

When moving to 40% the most important change will be how layers are switched to;
upcoming Kyria keyboard will have more thumb buttons for that purpose.

Inspiration taken from [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/). One remaining
difference is that navigation layer has second layer toggle key on the same hand; this is
something I've gotten used to and find useful. Also, there are still separate buttons for GUI
and SHIFT for easier learning curve.
